Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this location from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small place on the 2nd floor of the location It turned out that this was not the place we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex place so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The place itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the place and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a place but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the place i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new place what a wonderful waist of my time The place 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the place so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the place i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the place once again the location was fully booked and they had only 1 place left the one that was smaller but seems newer , Only the park outside of the location was beautiful ,,,2.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1,3
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery,No Negative, No real complaints the location was great great location surroundings places amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site arena is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",2,8
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, places are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most places are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the places are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no Bus empty fridge , Location was good and staff were ok It is cute location the nature range is nice Will go back ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",3,8
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, My place was dirty and I was afraid to walk Busefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my place was leaking luckily not on the place you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a place next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a location in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the location On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different place but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in place and ready to sleep , Great location in nice surroundings the Bus and arena are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,,,3.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",4,4
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a place I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s place was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of places on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again , Amazing location and building Romantic setting ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",5,7

Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night , The place was big enough and the place is good The nature food and service on the location is good outside the location there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",10,8
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, Nothing all great , places were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of place 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples arena menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this location to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",11,10
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid place numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our places The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner Bus closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and location price 260 , Style location places,,,5.8,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",12,6
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, The floor in my place was filfy dirty Very basic places I had a 20yr old tv in my place Fridge did not work Overpriced nature , Comfy place good location ,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",13,5
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery,No Negative, This location is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable place had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The nature selection was spectacular All considered this was a great location for the price and I plan to return ,,,9.2,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",14,10
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, The staff in the arena could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him , It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",15,9
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery,No Negative, This location is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The location inside is awesome and really cool and the place is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable place I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",16,10
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, Very steep steps in place up to the place not safe for children I asked to move places and was put in another identical one place decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse, Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",17,7
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery, We did not like the fact that nature was not included although you could pay extra for this The place we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathplace was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment , We loved the location of this location The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The location is lovely and the place was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",18,8
Mangalore,Sultan_Battery,No Negative, Public areas are lovely and the place was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathplace smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,,,7.1,"[' Family trip ', ' Group ']",19,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our place was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the location was lovely , I liked the locations history And for such an enormous location I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their nature It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",20,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, place was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit , Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental nature selection Quiet and relaxing area ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Travelers with friends ']",21,7
Mangalore,Kudroli, Our place was an overrated disaster place 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other places We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathplace is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole location dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic place is daylight robbery , The nature was the only positive element of this location original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the arena but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the location s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,,,3.8,[' Couple '],22,4
Mangalore,Kudroli, Sadly I cannot say that the places are clean enough for me When we got in our place we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our place We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the place on the curtain and in the bathplace there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other places And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing , The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The location locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The place was really comfortable ,,,5.4,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",23,6
Mangalore,Kudroli, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner , place was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",24,10
Mangalore,Kudroli, Nothing , Lovely location with extremely comfortable huge double place We stayed in the split level place which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a place all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and arenas are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the location All in all a beautiful location with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your place and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",25,10
Mangalore,Kudroli, The bathplace in our place was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv , Great location in the park near museums and arenas Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious places Big nature spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",26,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, Nothing at all to do with the location of course but people tend to Slam their placeplace doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all , The location itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the location easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean places places are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathplace was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair place service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the place Perfect location couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the arena downstairs is great Tennis court outside the location little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",27,10
Mangalore,Kudroli, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you , Great location original concept style,,,8.3,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",28,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, We had 2 different places here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathplace , The location itself is beautiful arena is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",29,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, There is an ongoing construction enlarging the location The location s arena is nice but overpriced The bathplace is not very practical , The location is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the location Public transportation and a nice bakery for nature are also close Good wifi all around the location ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",30,10
Mangalore,Kudroli, Little bit on the pricey side, The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the Bus arena area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",31,10
Mangalore,Kudroli, Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the place well there was one but it was very ineffective , Friendly staff The Bus arena area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",32,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, Our bathplace had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or Buss place was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and nature was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,No Positive,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",33,5
Mangalore,Kudroli, Please see above, The location is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the places can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",34,7
Mangalore,Kudroli, The places were cold Although nice the place decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two , The place was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",35,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The nature can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality , Very nice location manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different places They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the location is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and place is great ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",36,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my nature poor signs for temporary reception during renovation, the building meeting places modern style of my place park,,,7.1,"[' Family trip ', ' Group ']",37,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, The glass wall separating the bathplace and the toilet from the place is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more , Very nice location located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city locations are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the places are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to place ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",38,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the location I suppose if there is one thing the place I had did not have a view only other places but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my location place staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that, The location was amazing the place was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had nature at the arena on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked natures I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked nature like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the arena it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",39,9
Mangalore,Kudroli, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad nature was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet , Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",40,7
Mangalore,Kudroli, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard places are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the place being somewhat stuffy , The location is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",41,8
Mangalore,Kudroli, location undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair places that we had were tired and in need of some love First place had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another place which we duly transferred too which was better although bathplace lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the places we had just needed some care and attention and then the location would be first rate , Nice arena although felt nature was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",42,7
Mangalore,Kadri, location is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work nature staff was more interested in me signing the nature check although I prepaid the nature then serving my cappuccino place was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathplace very hot but not in the place Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the place no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again , Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk ,,,2.9,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",43,3
Mangalore,Kadri, Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that , Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back,,,9.6,"[' Family trip ', ' Group ']",44,10
Mangalore,Kadri, The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning , The brunch to purchase in the morning was good ,,,3.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",45,4
Mangalore,Kadri, Bathplace lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our place 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our place was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either , The location of the location is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The place was very comfortable The place was spacious enough for 2 people ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",46,8
Mangalore,Kadri, The location is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The place was nice but the bathplace is a glass box inside the placeplace it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathplace which I first discovered with my Busefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a location looking over a park yet the place looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 nature is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get nature somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this location is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this location even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else , Massive place,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",47,5
Mangalore,Kadri, The location is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The location arena was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups , The location looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The place was clean well decorated and the place was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",48,9
Mangalore,Kadri,No Negative, The quality of the location was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the location is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great Buss and arenas I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",49,10
Mangalore,Kadri, Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck place service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here, clean and new,,,5.4,"[' Family trip ', ' Couple ']",50,6
Mangalore,Kadri, The Bus was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a location Bus on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam , My place was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The place I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",51,10
Mangalore,Kadri, When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the place there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the place didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all , The location and views ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",52,8
Mangalore,Kadri, I loved everything , The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the places are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic places pillows and placesheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The arena with a view over the park is great to work and eat,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",53,10
Mangalore,Kadri,No Negative, Beautiful setting in a lovely park place very spacious clean and comfortable Bus area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",54,10

Mangalore,Kadri,No Negative, The location is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",56,10
Mangalore,Kadri, there was construction work going on in the location which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the Bus staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the Bus was open until 12 mid night , location in the park Cool interior design comfy place ,,,7.1,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",57,8
Mangalore,Kadri, Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our place were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task , Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam place was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to place at night place was clean location was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",58,8
Mangalore,Kadri, The location is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the place would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference , The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",59,8

Mangalore,Kadri, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The arena service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The location has many strange design choices too Had a double placeplace with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathplace shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathplace quickly You can see into the natures from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our place woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management , The property is beautiful,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",61,5
Mangalore,Kadri, The bathplace if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor , Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",62,8

Mangalore,Kadri, The bathplace was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass , Beautiful design comfortable place friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",69,8
Mangalore,Kadri, Our place didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the place Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the location to anyone , The bath and shower place was amazing Beautiful location They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",70,9
Mangalore,Kadri, The nature was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price , The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",71,7

Mangalore,Kadri, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this location The glass box in the corner of the place that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English nature tea in the arena where you had nature What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the place but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for nature The location was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the arena down while they were serving nature , Lovely location with lots of history Great food in the arena and a very comfy place,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",75,8

Mangalore,Kadri, The location is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your place starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large place but really it was not worth the money , The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely location ,,,5.4,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",81,6
Mangalore,Kadri, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy , Beautiful place that was ready early with the most comfortable massive place Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the location Especially the hall to our place ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",82,10
Mangalore,Kadri, The cleaniness of the places can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the places can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and place Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too arena some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star location , We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc ,,,5.8,"[' With a pet ', ' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",83,6

Mangalore,Kadri, The location is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your place or in the places above Mini Bus empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the place and quite noisy , The arena opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good nature with fresh orange juice WIFI in all location,,,7.9,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",85,8

Mangalore,Kadri, That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful location which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our place for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel , The place was really comfortable and loved the style of the location place place upstairs bathplace modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",87,8
Mangalore,Kadri, Maintenance work on facade of location no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above place was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no Busrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No miniBus Understaffed reception long wait , Pretty building interesting places ,,,5.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",88,6
Mangalore,Kadri, No ground floor place as requested 2 months ago first place totally freezing etc arena under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up , place changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences ,,,5.8,[' Couple '],89,6
Mangalore,Kadri, We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathplace had a horrible smell coming from the drain , places were large and modern and location was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",90,8
Mangalore,Kadri, Even allowing for the location being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturplace our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathplace had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at nature was very poor Shabby state of location with the exception of the places is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done , Large place ,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",91,5
Mangalore,Kadri, The place was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the place and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere , It s a beautiful location or should I say will be when the renovation is finished ,,,7.1,"[' Family trip ', ' Group ']",92,8
Mangalore,Kadri, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our place as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our place that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair , Good location Cheap ,,,5,"[' Family trip ', ' Couple ']",93,5
Mangalore,Kadri, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the places we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the places fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the place immediately The location covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a place They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The location management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated places for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the location Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathplace lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the places, Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the location is about 1km from the nearest metro station The places were tidy and the places were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the place like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star location in my opinnion ,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",94,5
Mangalore,Kadri, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathplace flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas , Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great nature ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",95,7
Mangalore,Kadri, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate , Great place very comfortable place Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local arenas frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",96,10
Mangalore,Kadri,No Negative, We upgraded to a larger place Had the bath infront of the place which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the places ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",97,10
Mangalore,Kadri, Our place was a little compact probably due to it being a loft place at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout , A very quirky location that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location place was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of location was outstanding ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",98,9
Mangalore,Kadri, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the place after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the place after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our place at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard nature was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,No Positive,,,5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",99,5
Mangalore,Kadri, split level placeplaces although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing , beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the location is really different,,,6.3,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",100,7

Mangalore,Kadri, location is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the arena was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the place had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the place really difficult to come down I thought, Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll ,,,4.6,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",102,5
Mangalore,Kadri, There was a girl working in the arena and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your arena , The place was amazing Actually our whole place large place The park burger at the arena downstairs was also heaven ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",103,9

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, Staff promised things they didn t deliver place was very small bathplace cramped location generally distant , Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer location but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",112,7
Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel,No Negative, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain locations The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique location lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The places are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge place on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",113,10

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, We would have liked to know in advance that the location is being renovated We had a place right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a place on the quiet side of the location , Very friendly staff lovely comfy place,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",116,8

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, the place next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathplace was really damp due to the wet place and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathplace after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware , place was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The location was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",119,8

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller places were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable place, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the location is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the nature was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",124,8
Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathplace meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The place wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The place place was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the place stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central, Liked the staff The location,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",125,5

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the place had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathplace and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the location and the choice would have fell on another location if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished , Good nature nice places nice to live at a location with history ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",133,8

Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the place was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the place at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our place He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the place security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better location and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,No Positive,,,2.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",147,3
Mangalore,St. Aloysius Chapel, The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathplace the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper , The place was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase ,,,5.4,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",148,6

Udupi,Malpe, There were construction works at the front of the location but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual places any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the place could have been abit neater ie The corners of the place were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major , The style of the place was unique and amazing with a light place laminate floors and a stunning black bathplace Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The location itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places location Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great location to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",150,10
Udupi,Malpe, More sofas needed in the Bus better nature options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed place was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on , Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the Buss were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky place ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",151,7
Udupi,Malpe, When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin place which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched places we got a far nicer place probably twice the size with a kingsize place so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with nature or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste , The place was super cosy The staff was nice The location isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",152,9
Udupi,Malpe, place 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers nature okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost , Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the location Got off to a bad start place 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bus staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",153,8

Udupi,Malpe, Being given a ridiculously small place initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the location the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the Bus later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly , Average good accommodation Big place Helpful staff place cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy place ,,,7.5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",157,8
Udupi,Malpe, The first night we got there we where put in a place where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathplace I raised this with the staff and was given another place However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean places properly but most importantly no clean place sheets They just come make ur place that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this location their places are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the place which was really annoying we had a place where I could see the toilet from the place Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid , The only good thing about this location is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the location sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from location it s cheaper Trains are not included in the location travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport ,,,5,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",158,5
Udupi,Malpe, I hate when the places are two separate places pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this location, The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",159,9

Udupi,Manipal, The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The place could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the location was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money , The place and size space in place was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our place for the money that we paid ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",168,8

Udupi,Manipal, nature was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day , Our place was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows Very memorable The location is right next to a large nice park Staff was friendly ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",171,10
Udupi,Manipal, The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding location looks rough The location looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect place service is very expensive and not good quality or as descriplace on the menu , The places were gorgeous bathplace to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the location interior very nice lovely atmosphere Due to building work In progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the Bus nice gesture ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",172,8
Udupi,Manipal, location under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no places for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a place which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate places for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe places but ended up being put in 2 twin places which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,No Positive,,,3.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",173,4
Udupi,Manipal, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the places were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the place was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking, The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the place was incredible,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",174,10
Udupi,Manipal,No Negative, The location is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our place was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the place temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The place layout with the placeplace upstairs was lush ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",175,10
Udupi,Manipal, The bathplace door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the place there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards , place service good quality staff,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",176,7
Udupi,Manipal, We didn t have a bad experience , We loved the setup of our place we liked the separation of the place from the rest of the place the meals were fantastic too very filling ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",177,9

Udupi,Manipal, nature not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level place that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it , Staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",180,8
Udupi,Manipal, They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back, absolutely stunning location lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",181,8
Udupi,Manipal, When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at location arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English natures , The placeplaces were pleasnt the place was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my place Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a place by 2ish which was good ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",182,8
Udupi,Manipal, Finding no car park when I had chosen a location with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to place the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the place down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting , The place was pleasant We liked the big bathplace and the place was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",183,5
Udupi,Manipal, The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathplace , Nice comfy and cosy places with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",184,9
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp , The place is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best I ve ever seen The staff is very kind I would very much recommend this location if you don t mind travel 20 min to the center ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",185,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half location were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion , The place we upgraded to was very nice ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",186,7
Udupi,Krishna Matt, nature was expensive and location could have benefited with a place Swimming pool, Location was close enough to anything we needed location was big clean spacious places and nice Bus with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",187,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The location is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the place was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathplace walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the place where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathplace The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The location is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another location , Polite staff ,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",188,5
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The bathplaces are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the Bus I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered location Arena It was more like an insult , The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The places were clean stylish and comfortable The location was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",189,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, the arena food was terrible my first place was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the location it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my place but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again , nothing,,,3.1,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",190,4
Udupi,Krishna Matt, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better place ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new place And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the location reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena, Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed,,,5.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",191,6
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Arena location is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the location just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard places have stairs places are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathplace No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No miniBus in place only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star location in reality it can be regarded as a 3 location only , Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center ,,,6,[' Solo traveler '],192,6
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful , The place was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",193,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the location, Very smart place good food ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",194,9
Udupi,Krishna Matt, No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor place where place was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine , nature Staff,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",195,8
Udupi,Krishna Matt, the building work created a bad first impression of the location as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in place uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathplace at night was a little precarious nature expensive in comparison to outside arenas , staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval location history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another place and see the location when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",196,9
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The place was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the place the towels never changed the fridge was empty the place was very small I don t understand how this location has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the location at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the location , The hall,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",197,5
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Partially frosted glass door into bathplace was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing , Nice staff good places with separate little living place and placeplace did not experience any problems with the reconstruction ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",198,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt,No Negative, Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful location the place I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of arenas nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",199,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, place particularly bathplace was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the place a clear sign that the place was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an location of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the location managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please , Very beautiful building cozy place cool Bus ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",200,7
Udupi,Krishna Matt,No Negative, Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic place with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the location but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the location arena,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",201,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Taxi from location to airport was extortionate price so we took the train nature was nice but very expensive , Close to Tram Excellent place nice staff ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",202,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Renovation around the location sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the miniBus but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the place They dont have a luggage place instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you ,No Positive,,,5.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",203,6
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The place wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathplace is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in location corridors for a few times , Good Wi fi ,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",204,7
Udupi,Krishna Matt,No Negative, Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",205,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, At first glance it looks like a dream location But then when you go see the location renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the place itself looked like dreams a place with two floors first floor shower toilet living place and a small refrigerator upstairs placeplace But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare place The doors of the places slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our place There really bad in this location because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the place may flooring and also hear every footstep in the place above you and from you Clean place we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked , The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious place received ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",206,7
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bus staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 location Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in place Having to ask for towels that were not left in the place place 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc , Character of the location was great Location was good,,,6.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",207,7
Udupi,Krishna Matt,No Negative, location and places were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this location provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this location which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this location ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",208,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future , The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The place itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",209,8
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Not given the place type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this location was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathplace as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to place level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid nature to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,No Positive,,,4.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",210,5
Udupi,Krishna Matt, next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay, friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful arena and Bus food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",211,10

Udupi,Krishna Matt, The location is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the location does need a facelift , Boutique atmosphere good size places with comfortable places and stylishly designed bathplaces ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",215,8
Udupi,Krishna Matt,No Negative, It was a well kept location in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful place with a view was a bonus ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",216,10
Udupi,Krishna Matt, Its hard to get back to the location later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet location as this one Not enough soap in the place arena Bus snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all , The location is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local Buss on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean place made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",217,10

Bangalore,Cubbon Park, The standard place was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger place We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that location But even the bigger place is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London locations The place did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the place was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the place but the bathplace was still very cold As in all London central locations this location is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price , Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for nature and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ', ' Romantic place ']",653,8

Bangalore,Cubbon Park, On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this location When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the location had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show , On this occasion the place was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathplace was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",663,9
Bangalore,Cubbon Park,No Negative, I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This location was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice location and staff Nice selection of food at nature Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",664,10
Bangalore,Cubbon Park, The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathplace was tiny , place was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a place change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated ,,,7.5,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",665,8

Bangalore,Cubbon Park, Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained , Very quiet area nice to have a place with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small location Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower ,,,8.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",667,9

Bangalore,Wonderla Amusement Park, Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the place was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive place expected executive service as was told no tables for available for nature They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which places are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot nature On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the location manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall , Location staff and cleanliness ,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",669,8
Bangalore,Wonderla Amusement Park, Attic place with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathplace although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London , Great nature all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel ,,,7.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",670,8
Bangalore,Wonderla Amusement Park, The location arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant , Good staff comfortable place and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive placeplace Excellent choice of food at nature The Bus area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",671,9

Uttara Kannada,Yana Rocks, Nothing your doing a fantastic job, Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the place everything was perfect from the start The location is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the location as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our place was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our place and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many locations in London but would definately choose apex again ,,,10,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1003,10
Uttara Kannada,Yana Rocks, The places were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathplace mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The placeplace windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the place It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the place The walkway outside the location place stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard location which did not even include nature The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better , It was located in a cosy corner off the street ,,,4.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",1004,5
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything , The staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the place look lovely,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1005,10
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction , Very nice location quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good location Bus I didn t use the arena neither for nature or evening so can t comment ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",1006,9
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, At the outside front entrance to the location there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great location , places were very comfy bathplace was fantastic and location was excellent ,,,8.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1007,9
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, We felt the price of nature is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay , The location of the location is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket ,,,6.7,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1008,7

Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, nature is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of nature to go on Fleet Street , places are quiet places are huge Bathplace is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud ,,,7.9,"[' Family trip ', ' Couple ']",1013,8
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, Service Also they would have given reductions or nature in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The location knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 places Felt short changed , Comfortable place which was very clean,,,5.8,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",1014,6
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical places He booked directly with Apex and got full natures included for the same place price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for natures even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison ,No Positive,,,9.2,"[' Family trip ', ' Family with young children ']",1015,10

Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, It took a little longer than expected for for the place service to be cleared from outside our place But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the place , location was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The place was spacious and the bathplace with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our place was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex location ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",1019,10
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the place nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet, location would have been great,,,5.8,"[' Family trip ', ' Solo traveler ']",1020,6
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, The nature system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental nature you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other nature was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over nature which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at nature was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this , place was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in place 149 which was the very end place on a corridor and we never heard a thing ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Group ']",1021,10
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli,No Negative, The location is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big locations maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturplace night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the location afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathplace at home The place we had was a good size the place was extremely comfortable and the place was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,,,9.6,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1022,10
Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, Service at the Bus we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the Bus Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental nature , Location of the location,,,7.1,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Family with young children ']",1023,8

Uttara Kannada,Dandeli, A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans , The place was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathplace with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior places are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable ,,,9.2,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ']",1025,10
